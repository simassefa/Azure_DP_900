kpi(key performance indicators )- type of perfomance measurement that a company or organization to detemine performnace over time 

Descriptive Analytics ( what happended ?) accurate comprehensive live-data and effective visulalization  e.g dashboards report KPI ROI
Diagnostics Analytics ( why did it happen ) drill down to investigate root cause focused on subset of descriptive analytics dataset 
Predictive Analytics ( what will happen) use historical data with statistics and ML to generate trends or predicitions 
Predictive Analytics ( what  will happen ) using hybrid data with ML to predict future scenarios that are exploitable 
congitive analytics ( what -if  this happens?) using ML and NLP t detemine what-if scenarios to create plans if they happen

# synapse SQL 
synapse SQL is a distrbuted version f T-sql designed for data warehouse workload
extend T-SQL to address streaming and machine learning scenarion
use built-in streaming capabilities to land data from cloud data source into SQL tables
integrate AI with SQL by using ML models to score data using the T-sql predict function and offers both serveless and dedicated resource models
for unpredictable workload (unplanned or bursty) use the always available , serverless SQL endpoint 
for predictable workload 
create dedicatated SQL pools to reserve processing power for data stored in SQL tables
