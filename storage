 # Micrsoft onedrive 
is a storage and storage synchronization service for files which resides in the cloud similar product  Dropbox, GoogleDrive, Box and micrsoft sharepoint 
# microsoft 365 sharepoint 
is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates into micrsoft offfice. intended for document management and shared storage 


A data lake is a centralized data repository for unstructure and semi structred data 
a data lake is intended to store vast amount of data 
Data lakes generally use object(blobs) or files as its storage medium 
Transform 
change or blend data into new semi-structored data using ETL/ELT engines 
Distribution 
allow access to data to various programs or APIS 
collect
pulling from various data source 
publish 
publish dataset to meta catalogs so anlaysts can quickly find useful data 
 # Blob storage 
cheapest storage type 
lifecycle management 
flat namespace 
slower query performance 
azure Data lake Storage Gen2 
build on top of Blob storage

data lake storage is azure Blog storage which is has been extended to support big data analytics workloads
designed to handle petabytes of data and hunderds of gigabits of throughput 
in order to efficiently access data, Data lake Storage adds a  hierarchical namespace to azure blob storage 
(access control list ACLs , throtting and Timeout Management Performance optimizations )
Hadoop compatabible file system (HDFS)
Big data analytics 
POSIX -like directory and file permissions
scalable 
Don't need to move data prior to analysis

# File type for Data storage 
csv
json
# Apach Avro 
binary format that great for write operation but slower to read ( not readble in normal text editer )
# Apach Parquet 
binary format that stores columnar data
schema/ metadata travels with the data 
fast query performance with reduced disk I/O

# Blob storage 
Blob storage is a object-store that is optimized for storing massive amount of unstructred data 
unstructured data is data that doesn't adhere to a particular data model or definition such as text or binary data 

storage account --- containers(similar to a flolder in a file system ) -- blobs (the actual data being stored 
)
Azure Storage support 3 type of blobs



1 Block blobs 
store text and binary data 
made up of blocks of data that can be managed individually
store up to about 4.75 tib of data 
2 append blobs 
optimized for append operations
ideal for scenarios such as logging data from virtual machine
3 page blobs 
store random access files up to 8 tb in size 

Aure Files --Use cases
use cases 
completely replace or supplement on -permise file servers Network Attach Storage (NAS) devices 
lift- and -shift your on-permise storage to the cloud via classic lift or hybrid lift 

storage design for efficient querying
how many bytes does your query read and/or write
how cpu intensive is the query 
field indexing 
primary key 
partition key 
row key
