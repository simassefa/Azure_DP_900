a data lake is intended to store vast amount of data 
Data lakes generally use object(blobs) or files as its storage medium 
Transform

collect
pulling from various data source 
publish

azure Data lake Storage Gen2 
data lake storage is azure Blog storage which is has been extended to support big data analytics workloads
designed to handle petabytes of data and hunderds of gigabits of throughput 
in order to efficiently access data, Data lake Storage adds a  hierarchical namespace to azure blob storage 
(access control list ACLs , throtting and Timeout Management Performance optimizations )
